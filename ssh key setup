Step 1: Generate a New SSH Key Pair
Open a terminal and run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location (/root/.ssh/id_rsa).

You can optionally enter a passphrase for added security, or just press Enter for no passphrase.

Step 2: Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent
Start the SSH agent:


eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:


ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Step 3: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account
Copy the public key to your clipboard:


cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Go to GitHub SSH and GPG keys settings.
https://github.com/settings/keys
Click on "New SSH key".
Paste the copied SSH key into the "Key" field.
Add a title for the key (e.g., "My Server") and click "Add SSH key".

Step 4: Verify the SSH Connection
Run the following command to test the SSH connection to GitHub:

ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message like this if the connection is successful:


Hi your_username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Step 5: Clone the Repository
Now you should be able to clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:<your_github_account>/tutorials.git
